    <h2>My Journey to programming C</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="./OIP-3079974025.jpg" alt="C programming language logo" width="100">
    <p>My journey in C programming began after learning some C++.
      C is simple but powerful, and it gives full control to the programmer.
      Unlike modern languages, C does not have OOP, templates, or a garbage collector,
      because its goal is to be fast and close to the hardware. But why not Python</p>
    <h3>History of C<h3>
        <p>C is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains widely
          used and influential.</p>

            <p>C[c] is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains
              widely used and influential. By design, C gives the programmer relatively direct access to the features of
              the typical CPU architecture, customized for the target instruction set. It has been and continues to be
              used to implement operating systems (especially kernels[10]), device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its
              use in application software has been decreasing.[11] C is used on computers that range from the largest
              supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems. </p>
