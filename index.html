        <p>My journey in C programming began after learning some C++.
        C is simple but powerful, and it gives full control to the programmer.
        Unlike modern languages, C does not have OOP, templates, or a garbage collector,
        because its goal is to be fast and close to the hardware. But why not Python you can view in compare C vs Python

          <p>C is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains
            widely used and influential. By design, C gives the programmer relatively direct access to the features of
            the typical CPU architecture, customized for the target instruction set. It has been and continues to be
            used to implement operating systems (especially kernels), device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its
            use in application software has been decreasing. C is used on computers that range from the largest
            supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems. <br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">reference</a>

      <h2>Why choosing C</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It is simple language but harder to mastering</li>
        <li>It is a foundation of programming language</li>
        <li>It is foundation Cybersecurity in for malware analysis</li>
      </ul>
